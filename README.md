## ‘What destroys a person when that person appears to be destroying himself?’[^1]

A rough-and-ready proof of concept for [Passive suicidality in a repressive U.S. political context](https://github.com/sskeen/bar_policy_suicidality).

***Description:*** Critical suicidology implicates oppressive societal hierarchies and cultural scripts in undermining human worth intra-psychically. Per Button:

> Individual cognitive strategies are really no match for a wider system of socialization that burns into the psyche a conception of responsible autonomous agency that contains, as its dark underside, self-loathing and potential self-destruction for failing to live up to its impossible demands.[^2]

The internalization of these systemic, “intrapolitical,” drivers of hopelessness may represent a key pathway to suicidal ideation. We fine-tuned theoretically grounded pretrained BERT and DistilBERT models to detect expressions of perceived burdensomeness, thwarted belongingness, self-hatred, and loneliness among r/SuicideWatch post authors. Embracing a radically reflexive methodology, which highlights and interrogates investigator subjectivity amid the act of knowledge creation, thematic analysis isolated potential collective and within-person psychopolitical determinants of suicidality.
